## Problem Statement
In recent years, Buffalo has experienced varying levels of criminal activity that impact community safety and resource allocation. The purpose of this data analysis project is to identify trends and patterns in crime across different neighborhoods of Buffalo, assess the effectiveness of current crime prevention strategies, and recommend data-driven measures to local authorities for enhancing public safety and optimizing law enforcement efforts.

## Project Overview
- Data Acquisition: Leveraged open government data to analyze crime trends over 17 years.
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Utilized Python for preliminary data analysis â€” removing duplicates, dropping unnecessary columns, renaming and reordering columns, and addressing missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Database Management: Imported the cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database, employing SQL for further exploratory data analysis.
- Visualization: Developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI, enabling users to filter data by year and council district. The dashboard illustrates total incident counts, top 10 crime categories, the most common days for incidents, and a complete time series analysis of the incidents.
